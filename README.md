Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
I have implemented the game Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (UTTT). Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a more
complex adaption of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

UTTT Gameplay
The board is composed of 9 Tic-Tac-Toe grids arranged in a 3x3 grid. The following is a brief description of the
gameplay:
• The game starts with the first player placing their mark (X or O) in any cell of any smaller board.
• The move determines the board on which the next player will play. Specifically, if the first player places their
mark in the top right cell of a small board, the next player must play on the top right small board.
• This rule continues, with the position of a move within a small board dictating where the next move must be
made within the larger board.
• To win a small board, a player must get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally, as in traditional tic tac toe.
• The larger game is won by winning three small boards in a row, again either horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally.

• If a player is supposed to make a move on a small board that is already won or drawn (entirely filled), they
may play on any board that is not won or drawn.
• The game ends when a player wins the larger board or there are no legal moves left, in which case the game
is a draw.
